### Our colours
You may be wondering what the 'gyr' part of our website URL means. They stand for <span style="color:green">g</span>reen, <span style="color:#e5e500">y</span>ellow and <span style="color:red">r</span>ed, which is also shown in our company logo at the top of the page.

Our colours represent a diverse culture and community here at SigNet, which also relates to the offices we have in many different countries. Our colours also represent us, SigNet, leading the way to a secure, wireless future.

The colours also represent diversity in project sizes; that is, we can scale to fit any project, big or small.
